This program is a simplified MATLAB code for implementing the discontinuous Galerkin method, and our focus is more on theoretical research.\\
As an extensible program, it can be easily modified to implement the discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method, local discontinuous Galerkin (LDG) method,
ultra-weak local discontinuous Galerkin (UWLDG) method, direct discontinuous Galerkin (DDG) method, and ultra-weak discontinuous Galerkin (UWDG) method,
yet it is only applicable to one-dimensional linear scalar equations.
